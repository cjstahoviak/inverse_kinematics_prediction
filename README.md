# inverse_kinematics_prediction
Solving the inverse kinematics problem using supervised learning.

## Setup
This repo uses a Conda environment configured in `environment.yml`. Here are the steps to set these up properly from this repos home folder:
1. Create an new Conda environment `conda env create -f environment.yml`
2. Activate the environment `conda activate Inverse-Kinematics-Prediction`

If changes are made to `environment.yml` then update by running `conda env update --file environment.yml --prune`

## TODO
## Create a graph and then generate an embedding based off the graph
## Write how are we generating our graphs, how are they being represented, how that works, what is generate graph
## what are the five lines converting the csv to the graph doing.
## change how we represent the graph
## figure out if its embedding
## what is the method its using to embed
## actual architecture
